# Pac-Man-Factory
This project allows a user to create as many images of a default PacMan image file. This image file can be placed anywhere on the browser screen, within the predefined borders. At any time, the user can click a button to make the Pacmen move. When they move, they will eventually hit a border. When they hit the border, they will change their direction and may change their image, to make them see as though they are turning around. 

To improve this project, I would make user editable borders that will change how far the Pacmen would move. I would also make a button to freeze the Pacmen in their position. I would also implement a user controlled scroll bar that lets them change the speed of the Pacmen.
